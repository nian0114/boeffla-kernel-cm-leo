	tristate "HID Pressure"
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the HID Sensor
	  Pressure.

	help
	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics pressures:
	  LPS331AP.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, will be created
	  these modules:
	  - st_pressure (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_pressure_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_pressure_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.

config IIO_ST_PRESS_I2C
	tristate
	depends on IIO_ST_PRESS
	depends on IIO_ST_SENSORS_I2C

config IIO_ST_PRESS_SPI
	tristate

	depends on IIO_ST_SENSORS_SPI

config BMP280
	tristate "BMP280 digital pressure sensor"
	depends on (I2C || SPI_MASTER) && SYSFS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Bosch Sensortec
	  digital pressure sensors BMP280.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bmp280-core.

config BMP280_I2C
	tristate "support I2C bus communication"
	depends on BMP280 && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support Bosch Sensortec digital pressure
	  sensor hooked to an I2C bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bmp280-i2c.

config BMP280_SPI
	tristate "support SPI bus communication"
	depends on BMP280 && SPI_MASTER
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support Bosch Sensortec digital pressure
	  sensor hooked to an SPI bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bmp280-spi.
